Installing PyAFS
================

To install PyAFS, you will first need to install Cython_, which you
can do by running::

  $ easy_install Cython

Once you've done that, to install PyAFS globally, run::

  $ python setup.py install

If you want to build PyAFS without installing it globally, you may
want to run::

  $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

which will build the C extensions in place next to their source,
allowing you to import the various modules, so long as your current
working directory is the root of the PyAFS source tree.
