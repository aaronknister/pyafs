This project is an attempt to develop a fully Python-based interface
to the AFS APIs. It is based on the Perl AFS module
(http://search.cpan.org/~nog/AFS-2.6.1).

The goal is essentially to implement the full "high-level" API of the
Perl modules in a combination of Python and Pyrex.

I am depending on patches from other people, beacuse I will not finish
this on my own. I think I've established enough of the structure that
others can see what I want the structure to look like.

Please be sure to sign off on your patches.
